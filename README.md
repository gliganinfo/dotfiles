I don't care about being *POSIX compliant*, I like to be functional -- that's
why I use FISH, cause it's awesome out-of-the-box: with syntax highlighting,
inline auto-suggestions based on history, tab completion with man-page data,
incredible wildcard support, there is no PS2 like in bash; the text fits
perfectly, and it also has web-based configuration.

Besides that, when you write scripts in fish you feel like you're writing in a
real programming language, in some things it's better than javascript.
